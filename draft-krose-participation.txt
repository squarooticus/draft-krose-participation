      Rethinking IETF participation for productivity and inclusion
                       draft-krose-participation

Abstract

   Full participation in the IETF has long required attendance at in-
   person meetings for a variety of reasons, only the most obvious of
   which is NomCom eligibility.  Compared to remote participants,
   attendees are generally better able to establish and solidify
   professional relationships with other engineers, promoting
   socialization of proposals for work and encouraging empathy for
   differing viewpoints.  All of these help to create the conditions in
   which rough consensus is possible.  In-person meeting attendance is
   also known to create conditions conducive to collaboration: in-person
   meetings frequently result in serendipitous cross-pollination of
   ideas across working groups and areas through unofficial interactions
   such as hallway conversations, shared meals, and working group
   session tourism.  The disruption of in-person meetings precipitated
   by the novel coronavirus has forced participants to alter the way
   they interact day-to-day.  This has resulted in broad experimentation
   in models of effective participation.  With both traditionally in-
   person meeting attendees and remote participants temporarily on an
   equal footing, universal remote collaboration has created an
   opportunity to examine the effects and to use this new understanding
   to reimagine IETF structures for more effective inclusion of remote
   participants as well as for more productive interactions overall,
   both in-person and online.

1.  Introduction

   For nearly thirty-five years, the IETF has met in-person at least 3
   times per year.  The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 precipitated the first
   interruption in this cadence in the organization's history.  Lorem
   ipsum

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  In-Person Meeting Model

   The existing IETF meeting model focuses primarily on in-person
   attendees, but with partial access to remote attendees, primarily for
   official technical events: working group sessions, workshops/
   presentations, the Hackathon, and the plenary.

3.1.  Advantages to Attendees

   *  Informal meetings

   *  Tourism, serendipity

   *  Developing professional relationships

   *  Socializing together builds bridges

3.2.  Barriers to Inclusion

   *  Cost

   *  Time

   *  Travel fatigue

3.3.  Challenges

   *  Difficulties of hybrid meetings

      -  Over time, greater provision has been given to remote attendees
         as technology improves and attention to remote collaboration
         issues has increased.

      -  That said, much of the value of in-person attendance cannot be
         realized remotely.  Notably, chance hallway conversations are
         inaccessible to remote attendees, as are meals and trips to the
         pub.  Much preliminary work, especially in socializing new work
         or ideas for modifying existing work, happen at these informal
         gatherings.

4.  All-Remote Meeting Model

4.1.  Advantages to Attendees

   *  Everyone on a (roughly) equal footing

   *  Collaboration in a session can be more seamless and effective than
      using the traditional mic line pattern

4.2.  Barriers to Innovation and Collaboration

   *  Meeting at night worse than jet lag

   *  No natural break from regular work

   *  Fewer opportunities for chance meetings and introductions

   *  Higher energy of activation for tourism

   *  Harder to attract new attendees if work is focused and technical:
      it's a tradeoff

5.  Future Imperfect

5.1.  Meet In-Person Annually

   Reduce the focus on in-person meetings while retaining an annual
   gathering for the unique value in-person meetings provide.

   Reducing meeting cadence can be viewed as an opportunity for IETF
   participants to use newly freed-up travel funding to participate in
   other standards development organizations, potentially to the benefit
   of both the IETF and these other SDOs.

5.1.1.  Structure

   Structure meetings around activities that uniquely benefit from in-
   person attendance.

   *  Running code (Hackathon, Code Sprint), Demos

   *  Area meetings

   *  Dispatch

   *  Plenary

   *  Informal side meetings

   *  Jump-starting new work

   *  Attracting new WG participants

   *  Catering to a broader audience

5.1.2.  Subsidize attendance for inclusion

   With only one meeting per year, the IETF could more realistically
   fund the attendance of worthy engineers from under- or unrepresented
   geographies or problem spaces for whom corporate funding is
   unavailable and for whom self-funding would be a hardship or
   impossible.  A group akin to NomCom could be developed to identify
   and select individuals according to appropriate criteria.

5.2.  Organize Remote Interims

   Redirect much of the effort spent on in-person meetings today toward
   effective remote collaboration.

   Encourage working groups to meet virtually at a regular cadence
   appropriate to their milestones and objectives.

   Provision technology for effective remote meetings to working groups.

   Encourage working groups to actively engage in outreach to other
   working groups where objectives or work meet, and to the broader IETF
   community via established channels to advertise work and attract
   additional participants.

6.  Related Issues

6.1.  NomCom Membership

   Limiting NomCom membership to those who could afford to frequently
   attend in-person meetings has long been considered a reasonable
   barrier to ballot-stuffing.  That said, the traditional criteria may
   be unrelated to the NomCom's history of excellence: it is not clear
   that requiring in-person meeting attendance has had an instrumental
   part in forming effective NomComs.  Furthermore, the traditional
   criteria exclude some deeply-engaged participants that either cannot
   or choose not to travel to in-person meetings.

   The stakeholders in IETF work number in the billions, but only a
   small subset are qualified to be involved in choosing the leadership
   of a community whose focus is in driving consensus on narrowly-scoped
   technical work.  Care must be taken to ensure that whatever replaces
   the traditional criteria for NomCom eligibility preserves or improves
   upon the excellence in judgment we have come to expect from the
   NomCom in choosing leadership candidate slates that prioritize the
   interests of internet users, while also better representing the full
   set of participants who have skin in the game, whether or not they
   attend in-person meetings.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document has no technical security considerations as enumerated
   by [RFC3552].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
