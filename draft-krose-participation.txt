      Rethinking IETF participation for productivity and inclusion
                       draft-krose-participation

Abstract

   Full participation in the IETF has long required attendance at in-
   person meetings for a variety of reasons, only the most obvious of
   which is NomCom eligibility.  In-person meeting attendance is known
   to be an effective way of fostering professional relationships among
   engineers, of easing socialization of proposals for standards work,
   and of developing empathy for different viewpoints and thus of
   encouraging compromise.  All of these help to create the conditions
   in which rough compromise is possible.  In addition, in-person
   meetings frequently result in serendipitous cross-pollination of
   ideas across working groups and areas through unofficial interactions
   such as hallway conversations, shared meals, and working group
   session tourism.  The disruption of in-person meetings precipitated
   by the novel coronavirus has forced participants to alter the way
   they engage in day-to-day interactions, which has resulted in broad
   experimentation in models of effective participation.  With both
   traditionally in-person meeting attendees and remote participants
   temporarily on an equal footing, universal remote collaboration has
   created an opportunity to examine the effects and to use this new
   understanding to reimagine IETF structures for more effective
   inclusion of remote participants as well as for more productive
   interactions overall, both in-person and online.

3.  NomCom Membership

   Limiting NomCom membership to those who could afford to frequently
   attend in-person meetings has long been considered a reasonable
   barrier to ballot-stuffing.  That said, the traditional criteria may
   be unrelated to the NomCom's history of excellence: it is not clear
   that requiring in-person meeting attendance has had an instrumental
   part in forming effective NomComs.  Furthermore, the traditional
   criteria exclude some deeply-engaged participants that either cannot
   or choose not to travel to in-person meetings.

   The stakeholders in IETF work number in the billions, but only a
   small subset are qualified to be involved in choosing the leadership
   of a community whose focus is in driving consensus on narrowly-scoped
   technical work.  Care must be taken to ensure that whatever replaces
   the traditional criteria for NomCom eligibility preserves or improves
   upon the excellence in judgment we have come to expect from the
   NomCom in choosing leadership candidate slates that prioritize the
   interests of internet users, while also better representing the full
   set of participants who have skin in the game, whether or not they
   attend in-person meetings.

4.  Security Considerations
