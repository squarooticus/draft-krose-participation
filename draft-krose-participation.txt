      Rethinking IETF participation for productivity and inclusion
                       draft-krose-participation

Abstract

   Full participation in the IETF has long required attendance at in-
   person meetings for a variety of reasons, only the most obvious of
   which is NomCom eligibility.  In-person meeting attendance is known
   to be an effective way of fostering professional relationships that
   help create conditions in which such participants' proposals rise
   above the din and are seriously considered, a prerequisite for
   achieving rough consensus.  In addition, in-person meetings result in
   serendipitous cross-pollination of ideas across working groups and
   areas through unofficial interactions such as hallway conversations,
   shared meals, and working group session tourism.  The disruption of
   in-person meetings precipitated by the novel coronavirus has forced
   participants to alter the way they engage in day-to-day interactions,
   which has resulted in broad experimentation in models of effective
   participation.  In putting both traditionally in-person meeting
   attendees and remote participants on a similar footing, it has also
   created an opportunity to reimagine IETF structures for more
   effective inclusion of remote participants as well as for more
   productive interactions, both in-person and online.
