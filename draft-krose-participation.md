--- abstract

Full participation in the IETF has long required attendance at in-person meetings for a variety of reasons, only the most obvious of which is NomCom eligibility.
Compared to remote participants, attendees are generally better able to establish and solidify professional relationships with other engineers, promoting socialization of proposals for work and encouraging empathy for differing viewpoints.
All of these help to create the conditions in which rough consensus is possible.
In-person meeting attendance is also known to create conditions conducive to collaboration: in-person meetings frequently result in serendipitous cross-pollination of ideas across working groups and areas through unofficial interactions such as hallway conversations, shared meals, and working group session tourism.
The disruption of in-person meetings precipitated by the novel coronavirus has forced participants to alter the way they interact day-to-day.
This has resulted in broad experimentation in models of effective participation.
With both traditionally in-person meeting attendees and remote participants temporarily on an equal footing, universal remote collaboration has created an opportunity to examine the effects and to use this new understanding to reimagine IETF structures for more effective inclusion of remote participants as well as for more productive interactions overall, both in-person and online.

# Introduction

For nearly thirty-five years, the IETF has met in-person at least 3 times per year. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 precipitated the first interruption in this cadence in the organization's history. Lorem ipsum


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# In-Person Meeting Model

The existing IETF meeting model focuses primarily on in-person attendees, but with partial access to remote attendees, primarily for official technical events: working group sessions, workshops/presentations, the Hackathon, and the plenary.

## Advantages to Attendees

- Informal meetings
- Tourism, serendipity
- Developing professional relationships
- Socializing together builds bridges

## Barriers to Inclusion

- Cost
- Time
- Travel fatigue

## Challenges

- Difficulties of hybrid meetings
    - Over time, greater provision has been given to remote attendees as technology improves and attention to remote collaboration issues has increased.
    - That said, much of the value of in-person attendance cannot be realized remotely. Notably, chance hallway conversations are inaccessible to remote attendees, as are meals and trips to the pub. Much preliminary work, especially in socializing new work or ideas for modifying existing work, happen at these informal gatherings.


# All-Remote Meeting Model

## Advantages to Attendees

- Everyone on a (roughly) equal footing
- Collaboration in a session can be more seamless and effective than using the traditional mic line pattern

## Barriers to Innovation and Collaboration

- Meeting at night worse than jet lag
- No natural break from regular work
- Fewer opportunities for chance meetings and introductions
- Higher energy of activation for tourism
- Harder to attract new attendees if work is focused and technical: it's a tradeoff


# Future Imperfect

## Meet In-Person Annually

Reduce the focus on in-person meetings while retaining an annual gathering for the unique value in-person meetings provide.

Reducing meeting cadence can be viewed as an opportunity for IETF participants to use newly freed-up travel funding to participate in other standards development organizations, potentially to the benefit of both the IETF and these other SDOs.

### Structure

Structure meetings around activities that uniquely benefit from in-person attendance.

- Running code (Hackathon, Code Sprint), Demos
- Area meetings
- Dispatch
- Plenary
- Informal side meetings
- Jump-starting new work
- Attracting new WG participants
- Catering to a broader audience

### Subsidize attendance for inclusion

With only one meeting per year, the IETF could more realistically fund the attendance of worthy engineers from under- or unrepresented geographies or problem spaces for whom corporate funding is unavailable and for whom self-funding would be a hardship or impossible. A group akin to NomCom could be developed to identify and select individuals according to appropriate criteria.

## Organize Remote Interims

Redirect much of the effort spent on in-person meetings today toward effective remote collaboration.

Encourage working groups to meet virtually at a regular cadence appropriate to their milestones and objectives.

Provision technology for effective remote meetings to working groups.

Encourage working groups to actively engage in outreach to other working groups where objectives or work meet, and to the broader IETF community via established channels to advertise work and attract additional participants.


# Related Issues

## NomCom Membership

Limiting NomCom membership to those who could afford to frequently attend in-person meetings has long been considered a reasonable barrier to ballot-stuffing. That said, the traditional criteria may be unrelated to the NomCom's history of excellence: it is not clear that requiring in-person meeting attendance has had an instrumental part in forming effective NomComs. Furthermore, the traditional criteria exclude some deeply-engaged participants that either cannot or choose not to travel to in-person meetings.

The stakeholders in IETF work number in the billions, but only a small subset are qualified to be involved in choosing the leadership of a community whose focus is in driving consensus on narrowly-scoped technical work. Care must be taken to ensure that whatever replaces the traditional criteria for NomCom eligibility preserves or improves upon the excellence in judgment we have come to expect from the NomCom in choosing leadership candidate slates that prioritize the interests of internet users, while also better representing the full set of participants who have skin in the game, whether or not they attend in-person meetings.
