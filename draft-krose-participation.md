--- abstract

Full participation in the IETF has long required attendance at in-person meetings for a variety of reasons, only the most obvious of which is NomCom eligibility.
In-person meeting attendance is known to be an effective way of fostering professional relationships among engineers, of easing socialization of proposals for standards work, and of developing empathy for different viewpoints and thus of encouraging compromise.
All of these help to create the conditions in which rough compromise is possible.
In addition, in-person meetings frequently result in serendipitous cross-pollination of ideas across working groups and areas through unofficial interactions such as hallway conversations, shared meals, and working group session tourism.
The disruption of in-person meetings precipitated by the novel coronavirus has forced participants to alter the way they engage in day-to-day interactions, which has resulted in broad experimentation in models of effective participation.
With both traditionally in-person meeting attendees and remote participants temporarily on an equal footing, universal remote collaboration has created an opportunity to examine the effects and to use this new understanding to reimagine IETF structures for more effective inclusion of remote participants as well as for more productive interactions overall, both in-person and online.

# Introduction

TODO Introduction


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# NomCom Membership

Limiting NomCom membership to those who could afford to frequently attend in-person meetings has long been considered a reasonable barrier to ballot-stuffing. That said, the traditional criteria may be unrelated to the NomCom's history of excellence: it is not clear that requiring in-person meeting attendance has had an instrumental part in forming effective NomComs. Furthermore, the traditional criteria exclude some deeply-engaged participants that either cannot or choose not to travel to in-person meetings.

The stakeholders in IETF work number in the billions, but only a small subset are qualified to be involved in choosing the leadership of a community whose focus is in driving consensus on narrowly-scoped technical work. Care must be taken to ensure that whatever replaces the traditional criteria for NomCom eligibility preserves or improves upon the excellence in judgment we have come to expect from the NomCom in choosing leadership candidate slates that prioritize the interests of internet users, while also better representing the full set of participants who have skin in the game, whether or not they attend in-person meetings.
